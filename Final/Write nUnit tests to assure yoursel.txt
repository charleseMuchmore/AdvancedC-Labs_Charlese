Write nUnit tests to assure yourself that you understand the classes and the logic that you'll need to implement your use case.  

If you are implementing the "Browse Recipes" use case, for example, you'll need to be able to 

-retrieve all of the information in your UI mock-up for all of the recipes in the system 
-retrieve all of the details for one recipe based on the primary key of the recipe


In my case:
-retrieve some app config information for the layout
   -colors
   -logo
   -backgrouncd image
   -home page text
   -brewery name?
   -default units?
-check userlogin information against the database to see if its a valid user
